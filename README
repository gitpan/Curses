This is a dynamic loadable curses module for perl5.  You can get this
package at any CPAN archive.  (You can also still get it at the
original site I provided, but I'm trying to phase that out.)

Please see the INSTALL document for how to install it on your system,
the Curses pod (located at the end of "Curses.pm") for known
incompatibilities with other Perl programs, and the end of this
document for known compile or install problems.

New in 1.01:

   o Makefile.PL expanded!  If you do a simple "perl Makefile.PL" now,
     it will try to set up defaults for you.  Hopefully, this'll work
     for most people.

   o Version consistency checks added.

   o OSF1 (v3.2) hints file.

   o DGUX hints file.

   o Bug fix in test.syms to make it behave better if dropped in ext/.

   o Bug fix in Curses.c, savetty().

   o Hints file for SunOS/ncurses.

   o More INSTALL info (ExtUtils::testlib, ncurses keyname() compile warning)

   o VMS support!  Courtesy of Peter Prymmer.

   o New LINES/COLS functions to complement the stdscr/curscr ones.
     According to Steven Kunz, these variables are all that aren't
     available when Curses to be compiled with the C backend of
     Malcolm Beattie's (excellent) compiler (alpha 3).

   o Renames to conform to hints osname:
       c-osf1.h   => c-dec_osf.h
       c-sco42.h  => c-sco.h

The "demo" program is for demonstration purposes only.  If it
references a function your version of curses doesn't have, wrap it in
an "eval" and try again.  Same goes double for the "gdc" program.
You can type "make cdemo" to make a C language version of the demo.
If you get the same results via "demo" and "cdemo", but they don't
look right, then it's a bug in your libcurses, not in Curses.

Many thanks Malcolm Beattie and Larry Wall, without whose code I could
steal I wouldn't have written this.  Enjoy!

Known Problems
--------------
NCurses
   getch() and getstr() don't work right under very old versions of
   ncurses (around v1.8.5).  Please upgrade to a newer version.
