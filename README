This is a dynamic loadable curses module for perl5.  You can get this
package at any CPAN archive, or from:

   ftp://ftp.ncsu.edu/pub/math/wsetzer/Curses-1.0.tar.gz

Mirrors take note:  This is also available as:

   ftp://ftp.ncsu.edu/pub/math/wsetzer/Curses/Curses-1.0.tar.gz

Please see the INSTALL document for how to install it on your system,
the Curses pod (located at the end of "Curses.pm") for
incompatibilities with other Perl programs, and the end of this
document for known compile or install problems.

New in 1.0:

   o Hey, a real release!  :-)

   o Note added in Makefile.PL to address the `top_env' problem when
     compiling for Solaris with gcc.

   o Another test program "gdc" from the ncurses distribution, ported
     quickly to perl.

   o IRIX hint file.

   o Better INSTALL instructions, I think.  I don't remember when I
     wrote them, so you might only see what you saw in alpa 9.

The "demo" program is for demonstration purposes only.  If it
references a function your version of curses doesn't have, wrap it in
an "eval" and try again.  Same goes double for the "gdc" program.

Many thanks Malcolm Beattie and Larry Wall, without whose code I could
steal I wouldn't have written this.  Enjoy!

Known Problems
--------------
Linux:
   getch() and getstr() don't work right under very old versions of
   ncurses.  Please upgrade to a newer version.
