This is a dynamic loadable curses module for perl5.  You can get this
package at any CPAN archive.

Please see the INSTALL document for how to install it on your system,
the Curses pod (located at the end of "Curses.pm") for known
incompatibilities with other Perl programs, and the end of this
document for known compile or install problems.

New in 1.02:

 o The constants OK and ERR were switched!  They should give the
   right values now.  (Doesn't anyone check their return codes? :-)

 o Rename of Curses.h to pCurses.h for case-impaired systems.

 o New functions supported:  newterm, set_term

 o New hints for BSDOS, BSD386, OS2, and MSWin32.

 My thanks to the following people:

 sjpaavol@cc.helsinki.fi   [newterm, set_term]
 jmorzins@MIT.EDU          [ERR <-> OK switched]
 karres@southwind.net      [BSDOS hints]
 gsar@engin.umich.edu      [MSWin32 hints and patches]
 cider@f5.com              [BSDOS hints]
 ilya@math.ohio-state.edu  [OS2 hints, pCurses fix]
 ashted@southern.edu       [BSDOS, BSD386 hints]


The "demo" program is for demonstration purposes only.  If it
references a function your version of curses doesn't have, wrap it in
an "eval" and try again.  Same goes double for the "gdc" program.
You can type "make cdemo" to make a C language version of the demo.
If you get the same results via "demo" and "cdemo", but they don't
look right, then it's a bug in your libcurses, not in Curses.

Many thanks Malcolm Beattie and Larry Wall, without whose code I could
steal I wouldn't have written this.  Enjoy!

Known Problems
--------------
NCurses
   getch() and getstr() don't work right under very old versions of
   ncurses (around v1.8.5).  Please upgrade to a newer version.
