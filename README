This is a dynamic loadable curses module for perl.  You can get this
package at any CPAN archive.

Please see the INSTALL document for how to install it on your system,
the Curses pod (located at the end of "Curses.pm") for known
incompatibilities with other Perl programs, and the end of this
document for known compile or install problems.

New in 1.05:

 o Added the missing support functions c_chstrlen, c_Screen2sv.
   Oops. :)

 o Updated DIAGNOSTICS section of pod.

 o Added typedef detection support.

 o Rearranged PANELS support a little.

 o Removed support for wattr_get, wattr_off, wattr_on, and
   wattr_set (for now).  I got the prototypes from ncurses-1.9.9g,
   but they apparently differ from the "standard" ones.

 o Renamed "lines" everywhere, 'cause some curses library writer
   was stupid enough to #define it.  (Go figure.)

 o Reworked "optional" arguments, which only affects newterm(),
   panel_above() and panel_below().  Now, if you want to specify
   "NULL" as an argument, use "undef" instead of omitting the
   argument.  (Don't worry if this doesn't make sense.  You
   probably aren't affected anyway.)

 o Added the ncurses "curs_mouse" functions, but I have no idea
   if they work.  I couldn't even get the C versions to work, so
   I had no way of testing them.  Feedback on these functions
   would be appreciated.

The "demo" program is for demonstration purposes only.  If it
references a function your version of curses doesn't have, wrap it in
an "eval" and try again.  Same goes double for the "gdc" program.
You can type "make cdemo" to make a C language version of the demo.
If you get the same results via "demo" and "cdemo", but they don't
look right, then it's a bug in your libcurses, not in Curses.

Enjoy!

Known Problems
--------------
NCurses
   getch() and getstr() don't work right under very old versions of
   ncurses (around v1.8.5).  Please upgrade to a newer version.

   panel_hidden() test is reversed in v1.9.9g.  Please upgrade to
   a newer version.

   Actually, there are several problems in v1.9.9g.  Please upgrade
   to a newer version.
