This is a dynamic loadable curses module for perl.  You can get this
package at any CPAN archive.

Please see the INSTALL document for how to install it on your system,
the Curses pod (located at the end of "Curses.pm") for known
incompatibilities with other Perl programs, and the end of this
document for known compile or install problems.

New in 1.04:

 o (1.03 was a test version.)

 o Completely retooled most of the important parts!  Reread the INSTALL
   document "just in case", but the changes should be mostly internal.

 o New release is now also covered under the GPL, to appease the
   license-challenged.

 o Dropped support/instructions for perl with version less than 5.003.

 o Fixed is_linetouched arg count.

 o Added a Curses::Screen::new to allow for object oriented calls.

 o Added suport for getmaxx() and getmaxy() for those Ultrix/Alpha
   libs that dont have the -yx version.

 o Added optional panel support!  [*]
   Thanks to Chris Leach <leachcj at bp.com>.

 o Renamed the variable "rs" in the border function so it would no
   longer conflict with one defined in threads.

 o Additional VMS fixes.

 o Additional support for IRIX.

 o OpenBSD hints.

 o Added support for the [ncurses] resize() function.

 o Added NCR MPRAS 3.02 hints.

 o Unpolluted na, sv_yes, sv_no, sv_undef.

 o Added DESTROY method to quell "invisible" complaints.

 o Added support for the COLORS and COLOR_PAIRS variables (and
   function equivalents).

 o Added cygwin hints.

 o Deleted support for the following functions.  (I couldn't remember
   where I got them in the first place, and in some cases they
   actually cause problems.)

     getattrs gettmode mvcur setterm

 o Also added support for the following functions.  (I think [hope]
   this is all of them :)

     attr_get attr_off attr_on attr_set chgat curs_set cursyncup
     def_prog_mode def_shell_mode delay_output delwin dupwin filter
     getsyx getwin has_key mvderwin napms putwin redrawln redrawwin
     reset_prog_mode reset_shell_mode scr_dump scr_init scr_restore
     scr_set setsyx slk_attr slk_attroff slk_attron slk_attrset
     slk_color syncdown syncup termattrs termname untouchwin use_env

 o Removed support for the following variables.  (They never worked,
   but now Curses won't even tell you they don't work.)

     ttytype My_term Def_term

[*] His full patch is yet to be integrated.  The parts clearing the
    way for forms and menu library support are not there yet.
    Maybe next time... :)

    I also reserve the right to fiddle around with package placement
    for panels.  Curses::Panels is a probable spot.

The "demo" program is for demonstration purposes only.  If it
references a function your version of curses doesn't have, wrap it in
an "eval" and try again.  Same goes double for the "gdc" program.
You can type "make cdemo" to make a C language version of the demo.
If you get the same results via "demo" and "cdemo", but they don't
look right, then it's a bug in your libcurses, not in Curses.

Enjoy!

Known Problems
--------------
NCurses
   getch() and getstr() don't work right under very old versions of
   ncurses (around v1.8.5).  Please upgrade to a newer version.

   panel_hidden() test is reversed in v1.9.9.g.  Please upgrade to
   a newer version.
