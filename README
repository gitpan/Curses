This is a dynamic loadable curses module for perl5.  You can get this
package at any CPAN archive, or from:

   ftp://ftp.ncsu.edu/pub/math/wsetzer/Curses-a9.tar.gz

Mirrors take note:  This is also available as:

   ftp://ftp.ncsu.edu/pub/math/wsetzer/Curses/Curses-a9.tar.gz

Please see the INSTALL document for how to install it on your system,
the Curses pod (located at the end of "Curses.pm") for
incompatibilities with other Perl programs, and the end of this
document for known compile or install problems.

New in alpha 9:

   o Bug fixes, new hint files, a "cdemo" to help debugging.

The "demo" program is for demonstration purposes only.  If it
references a function your version of curses doesn't have, wrap it in
an "eval" and try again.

Please note: If no serious problems crop up in this release, I'll
rename it Curses-1.00 in a couple of months and that'll probably be
the end of the supported maintenance on it.  I am presently working on
an "NCurses" module, based on the "ncurses" SysV-ish XSI4 compliant
free libcurses maintained by Z.M. Ben-Halid and Eric Raymond.  This is
a very good curses, and standardizing on one particular implementation
allows one to (finally) write portable scripts.

Many thanks Malcolm Beattie and Larry Wall, without whose code I could
steal I wouldn't have written this.  Enjoy!

Known Problems
--------------
Linux:
   getch() and getstr() don't work right under very old versions of
   ncurses.  Please upgrade to a newer version.
