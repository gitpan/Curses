First, this version *requires* perl5.001.  The enhancements to
the MakeMaker system are too substantial to ignore.  You'll find
that you can now install Curses into an already installed system.

1)  Make sure perl5.001 has been built.  Unpack "Curses-a8.tar.gz".  If
    you haven't installed perl5.001, move the "Curses" directory to
    "perl5.001/ext/Curses".  Go into the "Curses" directory.

2)  Look in the `hints' directory to see if any of the hint files are
    appropriate to your machine's OS.  If so, symlink or copy it to
    the file "c-config.h" in the current (Curses) directory.  If not,
    copy "hints/c-none.h" to "c-config.h" in the current directory.
    Then edit "c-config.h" and follow the directions.  If you have
    to "roll your own", be sure and save a copy.  A "make clean"
    will delete "c-config.h".  If you "rolled your own", please send
    me a copy so I can include it in future distributions (see
    "hints/c-isc.h" for an example of a user-contributed "c-config.h").

3)  Edit "Makefile.PL" and pick or add the appropriate options.

4)  perl Makefile.PL

5)  make

    `make' will first run a perl script called `test.syms' that
    generates the file "Curses.h".  It should do a pretty good job,
    but if you find that it isn't picking up the correct values, you
    can edit "Curses.h" by hand and follow the directions.  If you
    have to "roll your own", be sure and save a copy.  A "make clean"
    will delete "Curses.h".

    `make' will then try to compile "Curses.c".  If you get any
    undefined curses symbols, it means that your curses really doesn't
    have those functions, and you should edit "Curses.h" and/or
    "c-config.h" and change the #define to #undef for that function.

    If you get other compile errors, it is probably because the curses
    include file and the perl include files are conflicting.  You'll
    have to figure out what's wrong and add proper C code to
    "c-config.h".  See "hints/c-sunos.sysv.h" for an example of how to
    do this.

    One common problem: If the compile of Curses.c fails because of an
    undefined type "chtype", put "#define chtype int" in "c-config.h"
    after the include file (see "hints/c-sunos.bsd.h" for an example).

6)  Enjoy!

    If your enjoyment is ruined (:-) because the module doesn't work
    right, peruse the Curses pod document (located at the end of
    "Curses.pm") for incompatibilities with other Perl programs.  Also
    check the end of the "README" for problems that may exist for your
    particular libcurses.a or operating system.
