These are notes for the maintainer.

Steps to release:

  - Test the build:

    make realclean
    Set up environment variables, c-config.h if required.
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    perl -Mblib -MCurses -e1

  - make realclean

  - Update HISTORY file with description of new stuff and release date.

  - Copy the changes for the current release in README.

  - Update version number in Makefile.PL (search for VERSION).

  - Update version number in Curses.pm (search for VERSION).

  - Make a tarball with something like this:

    tar --file=/tmp/Curses-1.07.tgz --gzip --create Curses-1.07

  - Upload via pause.perl.org.

    It goes into CPAN in the directory belonging to the user who
    uploaded it.  PAUSE gives you various options for uploading, tells
    you how to follow the progress of the uploading and indexing, and
    sends you emails about it.

  - PAUSE will automatically extract the README file from the tarball
    and install it as e.g. Curses-1.07.readme

  - PAUSE will open the tarball automatically and index the packages it finds
    in there by name (Curses::Window, Curses::Screen, etc.).

    It will find and index the package "Gen" and extract its README too.  I'm
    pretty sure this is wrong -- this looks like it's just supposed to be a
    private thing used in the build.  Someday, we should find a way to stop
    this.
