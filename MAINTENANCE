These are notes for the maintainer.

Steps to release:

  - Update HISTORY file with description of new stuff and release date.

  - Copy the changes for the current release in README.

  - Update version number in Makefile.PL (search for VERSION).

  - Update version number in Curses.pm (search for VERSION).

  - Make a tarball named like Curses-1.07.tgz .

  - Upload via pause.perl.org.

  - PAUSE will automatically extract the README file from the tarball
    and install it as e.g. Curses-1.07.readme

  - PAUSE will open the tarball automatically and index the packages it finds
    in there by name (Curses::Window, Curses::Screen, etc.).

    It will find and index the package "Gen" and extract its README too.  I'm
    pretty sure this is wrong -- this looks like it's just supposed to be a
    private thing used in the build.  Someday, we should find a way to stop
    this.
