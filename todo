Dear William Setzer,

Thanks a lot for your work on curseperl.

I've ported it to Perl5 and DYNIX/ptx for the Sequent platform.

Following are the changes to Makefile.PL and the proper c-config.h setup:

1. Makefile.PL:
The -lc below is necessary to avoid the following problem, as getwidth
resides in /lib/libc.a:

-----
$ perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib demo
Can't load 'blib/arch/auto/Curses/Curses.so' for module Curses: dynamic linker: 
perl: relocation error: symbol not found: _getwidth at /usr/local/lib/perl5/Dyna
Loader.pm line 140.

 at blib/lib/Curses.pm line 8
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at demo line 3.
-----

I've removed "-ltermcap" because libtercap.a is just a link to libcurses.a
on DYNIX.

# DYNIX/ptx (Sequent platform) 4.1.3 (and probably other versions of Dynix):
# Wed Nov 20 09:40:27 CST 1996, Carson Wilson, Walgreens
$inc  = "";
$libs = "-lcurses -lc";

2. c-config.h

/* Change each #undef below to #define if the answer to the question
 * beside it is "yes".
 */
#define C_LONGNAME      /* Does longname() exist?               */
#define C_LONG0ARGS     /* Does longname() take 0 arguments?    */
#undef  C_LONG2ARGS     /* Does longname() take 2 arguments?    */

#define C_TOUCHLINE     /* Does touchline() exist?              */
#define C_TOUCH3ARGS    /* Does touchline() take 3 arguments?   */
#undef  C_TOUCH4ARGS    /* Does touchline() take 4 arguments?   */

I hope you can include these in the next release; please let me know
if there is anything else you need.
