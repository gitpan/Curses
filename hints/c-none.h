/* Some Curses include files have problems interacting with perl,
 * some are missing basic functionality, and some just plain do
 * weird things.  Unfortunately, there's no way to anticipate all
 * of the problems the curses include file + "perl.h" might create.
 *
 * If you find that you can't compile Curses.c because of these
 * conflicts, you should insert C code before and after the "include"
 * file above to try and fix the problems.  "See c-sunos.sysv.h"
 * for an example of this.
